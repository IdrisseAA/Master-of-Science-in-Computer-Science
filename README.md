# Master of Science in Computer Science

I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science at Gazi University, Ankara, Türkiye.
Below are details regarding my contributions through a published paper and my Master's thesis.


## About the Publication

I presented a research paper at the ICES Proceedings, hosted by Azerbaijan Technical University, held in Baku on November 11-12, 2022.
The paper, titled *"A Lightweight Deep Learning Model for the Classification of a Limited Lung Sound Dataset,"* is a part of my Master's thesis.
The full proceedings book can be accessed via [*https://www.iensci.org/_files/ugd/614b1f_4451049bd89b468ba8623e97556e3877.pdf*](https://www.iensci.org/_files/ugd/614b1f_4451049bd89b468ba8623e97556e3877.pdf).
My publication is located on pages 432 to 437.


## About My Master’s Thesis

My Master's thesis, conducted at Gazi University, focused on developing deep learning models for the classification of abnormal lung sounds.
The full thesis is available in Türkiye's national thesis repository and can be accessed at [*Classification of abnormal respiratory sounds using deep learning techniques / Solunum seslerinin derin öğrenme yöntemleri ile sınıflandırılması*](https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/TezGoster?key=nLNfCsWgUluh5T2iyudShqi_iUP9Nx1oBASySJqMRHnMnFAA2ys_OQPZqGmYY6Ma).
The thesis is written in English and includes a long abstract in Turkish language.



Thank you
